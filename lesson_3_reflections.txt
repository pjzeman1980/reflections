When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you want your work to be viewable by other users or if you want to be able to access and contribute to your work from multiple computers that a remote repository would be essential.  Also, creating a remote repository provides some mechanism of backup in case something should go wrong with your local machine.  

One might not want to create a remote repository if the project is private and there is no desire to ever share it, or if security is a concern.  This is also the case if there is not internet access which would force the user to work exclusively local.
